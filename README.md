# Mosaic - Creative Version Control

Mosaic is a visual version control system designed specifically for creative projects. Unlike traditional version control systems that use technical jargon and are built for programmers, Mosaic creates a visual representation of collaborative creative work through an intuitive, engaging interface.

## Core Concept

Mosaic represents creative projects as interlocking colored tiles that together form a beautiful, interactive canvas. The system automatically allocates IP (Intellectual Property) rights based on contributions, making it ideal for creative collaborations where both concept creators and executors deserve fair recognition.

## Key Features

### Visual Representation

- **Tiles**: Each main project appears as a colorful tile in the mosaic. The size of a tile represents the amount of work invested in that project.
- **Splinters**: When clicking on a tile with children, the mosaic "shatters" to reveal Splinters - variations of the original project that maintain its core vision while exploring new directions.
- **Fragments**: Splinters can be further broken down into Fragments, which are more radical reinterpretations that take creative liberties while acknowledging the source.

### IP Rights Allocation

Mosaic uses a sophisticated algorithm to determine intellectual property rights:
- **Concept Creation**: 40% weight - Recognizes the value of original ideas
- **Execution Work**: 60% weight - Values the effort to bring concepts to life
- The system ensures idea originators get proper credit even if they partner with others for execution

### Accessibility First

- Designed for non-technical users with intuitive visuals and interactions
- Removes git jargon and replaces it with creative-friendly terminology
- Engaging animations and sound effects create an immersive creative experience

## Use Cases

Mosaic is perfect for:
- **Visual Artists**: Track iterations and collaborations on designs and artworks
- **Writers**: Manage collaborative essays, publications, and written content
- **Multimedia Projects**: Handle complex projects involving multiple creative disciplines
- **Creative Teams**: Ensure fair attribution of credit and IP in team environments

## Technical Implementation

Mosaic is built with:
- **React**: For a responsive, component-based UI
- **Canvas API**: For rendering the intricate mosaic visualization
- **Node.js**: For the local development environment

The visualization uses a sophisticated algorithm to generate interlocking, irregular polygons that fill the canvas while representing data about each project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the mosaic

## Terminology

| Traditional VCS | Mosaic Term | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Repository | Tile | A main creative project |
| Branch | Splinter | A variation of the original project |
| Fork | Fragment | A reinterpretation of a splinter |
| Main | Main Mosaic | The primary collection of projects |
| Commit | Contribution | An addition to the creative work |

## Future Development

- Collaborative real-time editing
- Export and licensing options for finalized projects
- Integration with creative tools (Adobe Creative Cloud, etc.)
- Community features for public creative projects

## Philosophy

Mosaic is built on the belief that creative work flourishes through collaboration, but all contributors deserve fair recognition. Like the timeless artistry of Roman mosaics, each contribution builds a unique whole, celebrating collective creativity while honoring individual input.

We believe in fostering collaboration, sharing intellectual property fairly, and tracing the genealogy of ideas so that credit flows to everyone involved in bringing a creative project to life.
